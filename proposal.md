# General description of project
> Automating the tracking of sign in protocols for RI Shooting Club

# Goals of project
> Simplify ensuring that every member has signed attendance, signed out/in their firearm, as well as the tracking of pellets used.

# Listing of features
> List all the features in the fully functional app - you may choose to work on a subset of this listing to produce a MVP (minimum viable product) given constraint of time

# External Scanning
> I'm sure there are inventory trackers available, but not as specific as what I'm trying to implement.

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> Every session, members must sign 3 different books, one for attendance, one for firearms, and one for pellets used.
> The CCALs must tally all 3 boks to ensure every member has signed every one, as well as visually confirm that the number of people in the range is the same as those signed.
> At the end of each session, the teacher-in-charge will have to acknowledge the signing of pellets and firearms.
> A log has to be kept of all firearm movements, as well as pellet use in this log book (can implement a search function to more easily view the movement by certain people, firearms, or date)

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> Efficient search methods?
> Efficient memory use (considering that every day 13 entries are added, and all history must be kept easily available)
